# What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence. Using computing, we design systems that can learn from data in a manner of being trained. The systems might learn and improve with experience, and with time, refine a model that can be used to predict outcomes of questions based on the previous learning.

# Machine Learning's Beginning

## Alan Turing
http://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing

## Arthur Samuel
In 1959, Arthur Samuel defined machine learning as, "[A] Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."

## Tom M. Mitchell
A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with the experience E.

# Two Types of Machine Learning

- Supervised learning refers to working with a set of labeled training data. For every example in the training data you have an input object and an output object. 
- Unsupervised Learning - On the opposite end of this spectrum is unsupervised learning, where you let the algorithm find a hidden pattern in a load of data. With unsupervised learn- ing there is no right or wrong answer; itâ€™s just a case of running the machine learning algorithm and seeing what patterns and outcomes occur.
